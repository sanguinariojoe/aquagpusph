        <!-- We are starting the simulation in rest state, slowly increasing
        the velocity until the final steady {{U}} velocity (set in Create.py)
        is reached. It imply changing the inlet & outlet velocities, as well
        as introducing a non-inertial term.
        Since we want that the non-inertial term is affecting also to the inlet
        and outlet area particles, we must do it right after both methods. -->
