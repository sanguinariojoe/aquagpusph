<!-- Particles refinement and de-refinement.

This module depends on basic/domain.xml module, which should be included as
well. This module should be included once.

In order to modify the number of iterations to transfer the mass between partner
and children, redefine M_ITERS.

To use this module you should:
1.- Include this module file
2.- Modify your particles set definitions to read the field m0 instead of m
3.- Add initial values for miter (usually equal to M_ITERS) and ilevel
4.- Add the distance between particles at 0 level refinement, dr_level0, to each
    particles set.
5.- Load a module from basic/multiresolution folder to set the refinement areas
You can also redefine the variable M_ITERS to modify the number of time steps
required to transfer the mas from partner particles to children ones.

Boundary elements/particles are not never split or coalesced.

You can find an usage example in examples/2D/cylinder_inside_channel

        <!--    Refinement level
             ======================
        In order to determine whether a particle should become split, coalesced
        or even preserved, we must known the refinement level required. Such
        operation is relegated to the user. However, herein we are adding a
        dummy tool to signaling him where it should done. Also we are
        restarting the level to the default one, 0 -->

        <!--    Mass transfer
             ===================
        When a partner particle is split/coalesced in one or more children
        particles, it is not instantaneously removed. Instead, its mass is
        progressively transfered. The user may control the number of time steps
        before the mass is completely transfered from partners to children
        defining the variable M_ITERS (10 by default). When a partner particle
        lost all its mass, it is removed (i.e. sent to the buffer) -->

        <!--    Particles split
             =====================
        When a particle is marked with a refinement level bigger than its level,
        then such particle should be split, such that it turns into a partner
        particle, and 4/8 children particles are generated and associated to
        him. This process is a bit complex:
        1.- Each particle is analyzed to checkif it is already
        spliting/coalescing. If that's the case, the particle is ignored.
        2.- The remaining particles are checked looking for the ones which
        its refinement level is lower to the target one, and mark them to become
        split
        3.- The list of particles to become split is sorted as
        "non-split"/"split"/"out of bounds".
        4.- Then the new children particles are generated

        <!--    Particles coalesce
             ========================
        When a particle has a refinement level target lower than its current
        level, it should become coalesced with other similar particles. Due to
        the nature of the method, that's a quite complex operation, which is
        solved as follows:
        1.- Seeds detection. The seeds are the particle which will represent
        each group of coalescing particles.
            1.a.- All the candidate particles to become coalesced are signaled,
            and placed in a regular grid of dr/2^level
            1.b.- Just one particle of each cell is kept (the most centered one)
        2.- Coalescing candidates. All the neighbour particles of the seeds,
        which has the same refinement level and are not seeds, will be marked as
        coalescer
        3.- Each coalescer will look for the closest seed, and associate with
        that.
        4.- Finally a new partner particle is generated on top of the coalescing
        particles data.

             ===============================
        As commented above, when a partner particle lost all its mass (which
        has been transfered to the children), it is converted into a buffer
