Fixed ghost particles boundary condition. Actually, this boundary condition is
an extension of the dummy particles boundary condition, where the physical
fields are interpolated from the fluid.
To do that, the dummy particles (imove=-1) are associated with a boundary
element (imove=-2), such that the position of the ghost particles can be
mirrored with respect such element in order to interpolate the fields.

The main benefit of the ghost particles are the great conservation properties.
However treating with complex geometries may become hard due to the requirement
of the generation of the extended fluid.

To use this boundary condition you should include this preset, and properly set
the associations array within the input file (set it to N for the particles
which should not be mirrored at all).

Remarks:
  - This file should be included once.
  - It is intended that the ghost particles have the flag imove = -1.
  - Regarding the mirroring boundary elements, it is intended that they have
    the flag imove = -2, and a unit normal. Also the area of the elements should
    be stored in the mass array "m".
  - Ghost particles have a very good momentum, mass and energy conservation
    properties.
  - Unfortunately, leading with complex geometries is not so easy.
  - By default, no-slip boundary condition is considered. To enforce the
    free-slip boundary condition include the preset GPFreeSlip.xml
