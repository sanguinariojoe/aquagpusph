<!-- energy_kin.xml
Total kinetic energy computation. The main difference with respect to the
kinetic energy computed by energy.xml is that this preset does not require
integrating the kinetic power.

To use this preset just include this file. The kinetic energy will be stored in
the variable energy_Kin

Note: energy_kin.xml should be included before inlet.xml and outlet.xml in order
to exclude the "buffer" particles becoming injected/removing from the system.
