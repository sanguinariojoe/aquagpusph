<!-- cfd.xml
This is the main preset to create CFD simulations using SPH. To use it,
basic.xml should be loaded first.

Within this preset, no boundary conditions are loaded, or in other words, purely
dummy particles are considered.

In case that solid boundaries should be enforced, consider loading Boundary
Integrals (BI.xml) or Mirror particles(GhostParticles.xml). Also you can add the
elastic bounce condition to enforce the unpenetrability.

In case or symmetric planes use symmetry.xml.

In case of inflow/outflow use inlet.xml and outlet.xml.

However, sensor values are already computed within this preset, out of the box.
In the sensors the values of density, pressure and velocity are interpolated.
