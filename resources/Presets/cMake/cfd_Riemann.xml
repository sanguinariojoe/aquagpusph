<!-- cfd.xml
This is the main preset to create CFD compressible simulations with a Riemann solver in SPH. 
To use it, basic.xml should be loaded first.

Within this preset, no boundary conditions are loaded, or in other words, purely
dummy particles are considered.

In case that solid boundaries should be enforced, consider loading Boundary
Integrals (BI.xml) or Mirror particles(GhostParticles.xml). Also you can add the
elastic bounce condition to enforce the unpenetrability.

In case or symmetric planes use symmetry.xml.

In case of inflow/outflow use inlet.xml and outlet.xml.

The method has been implemented following the papers:
Parshikov et al. International Journal of Impact Engineering 24 (2000) 779-796
Parshikov et al. Journal Computational Physics 180, 358-382 (2002)

Riemann problem can be studied in the book of Toro on Riemann solvers.
