<!-- This module allows to use an infinite plane to set a boundaries with other
process.

You just need to include this module after MPI.xml, and set the variables:

 - mpi_plane_r: Bottom-left-back corner of the bounding box
 - mpi_plane_n: The outward pointing normal of the planes
 - mpi_plane_proc: Process id at the other side of the plane

You can add this module several times to add several bounding planes. In that
case, just edit the mpi_plane_r and mpi_plane_normal before the tool is
executed ("mpi bound" tool). You can use prefixes when including for that.
