<!-- FixedParticles.xml
This basic boundary condition is a some sort of simplified Ghost Particles
boundary condition, where the properties of the boundary particles is not
extrapolated from the fluid and boundary information.
Along this line, this boundary condition can be successfully applied to examples
where the boundary particles are far away enough to can consider their field
values constant (see the shock chamber example). Otherwise, the tools to
conveniently update the field values should be added by the user.

Since Omega term should be computed for the fixed particles as well, which is
resulting from the interactions with other fluid and boundary particles, enough
layers of fixed particles should be placed to covert a distance 2*SUPPORT*H,
where H is the maximum expected kernel length value

Remarks:
  - This file should be included once.
  - It is intended that the fixed particles have the flag imove = -1.
  - By default, no-slip boundary condition is considered.
