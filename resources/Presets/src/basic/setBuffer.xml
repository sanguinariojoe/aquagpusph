<!-- This preset counts the number of buffer particles at the end of the stack,
already available to become consumed (buffer particles are signaled with an
imove value of -255). Known the total number of particles, and the number of
buffer ones at the end, you can program your tool to consume them thread by
thread.
In order to allow other tools to continue consuming buffer particles, please use
them in order (leaving the remaining buffer particles at the end).
The user is responsible of checking that the buffer particle to become consumed
is not out of bounds (id >= N).
To use this preset, just simply add a dummy tool called "Set buffer" (a prefix
and suffix can be optionally appended), and include this file at the end of the
module. For instance:

<Tools>
    <Tool name="Set buffer" action="add" type="dummy" />
    <Tool name="consumer" action="add" type="kernel" path="bufferConsume.cl"/>
</Tools>
<Include file="setBuffer.xml" when="end">

where "consumer" is the tool where buffer particles are consumed to produce
actual particles (and where the variable nbuffer can be used). This module can
be safely included several times.

Don't include this file with a prefix.
Ensure that the buffer particles are consumed always after the Sort process,
such that they are always placed at the end of the stack
Ensure that no new buffer particles are generated before all the consumers have
been executed.
