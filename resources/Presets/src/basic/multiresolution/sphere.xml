<!-- Particles refinement sphere

This module depends on basic/multiresolution.xml module, which should be
included BEFORE this one.

To use this module, include this file, and modify the sphere center and radius,
as well as the level of refinement, multiresolution_sphere_level. Several
refinement areas can be defined, including this file several times, and
conveniently reevaluating the variables before the tool "basic refinement
sphere":

<Include file="basic/multiresolution/sphere.xml" prefix="sphere0_"/>
<Include file="basic/multiresolution/sphere.xml" prefix="sphere1_"/>
<Tools>
    <Tool action="insert" before="sphere0_basic refinement sphere" type="set_scalar" name="sphere0_min" in="multiresolution_sphere_center" value="0.0,0.0"/>
    <Tool action="insert" before="sphere0_basic refinement sphere" type="set_scalar" name="sphere0_max" in="multiresolution_sphere_radius" value="1.0"/>
    <Tool action="insert" before="sphere0_basic refinement sphere" type="set_scalar" name="sphere0_level" in="multiresolution_sphere_level" value="1"/>
    <Tool action="insert" before="sphere1_basic refinement sphere" type="set_scalar" name="sphere1_min" in="multiresolution_sphere_center" value="2.0,0.0"/>
    <Tool action="insert" before="sphere1_basic refinement sphere" type="set_scalar" name="sphere1_max" in="multiresolution_sphere_radius" value="1.5"/>
    <Tool action="insert" before="sphere1_basic refinement sphere" type="set_scalar" name="sphere1_level" in="multiresolution_sphere_level" value="2"/>
</Tools>

In case of several refinement areas overlapped, the highest refinement level
will be chosen. Ensure that the particle may not jump more than one refinement
level in a single time step. Otherwise the gamma_m variable may become wrongly
computed.
