<!-- forces.xml
Pressure forces and moments, over solid boundaries, runtime postprocessor. With
this preset the forces caused by the Boundary Integrals (BI.xml) and by the
Ghost Particles (GP.xml) are computed and stored in separate variables.

To use it, just include this file, and later set the initial values for the
variables:
pressureForces_iset = Particles set index affected where the forces should be
                      computed.
pressureForces_r    = Position of the center of rotation.

This preset is generating the following variables which are the global forces
and moments with respect to pressureForces_r:
pressureForces_F_GP = Force due to the Ghost Particles 
pressureForces_M_GP = Moment due to the Ghost Particles
pressureForces_F_BI = Force due to the Boundary Integrals
pressureForces_M_BI = Moment due to the Boundary Integrals

If you want to get the forces on several bodies this preset can be included
several times using different prefixes. How to do it depends on whether BI or
GP are used to enforce the boundary conditions. It is strongly recommended not
mixing boundary conditions.

If you wish to compute the global force for confined flows maybe you prefer to
use forces.xml
