<!-- MLS.xml
Compute the MLS transformation matrix \f$ L_i \f$.

Such transformation matrix can be multiplied by the kernel gradient to produce
a new kernel gradient,
\f$ \nabla W^{L}_{ij} = L_i \cdot \nabla W_{ij} \f$, such that the lienar fields
differential operators are consistently computed

This tool is just computing the kernel transforamtion matrix. The usage of such
matrix is responsibility of the user.

To use it, just include this file. If you include this file several times, the
effect will be override (and computed just once). Therefore, please don't
include this preset with a prefix.

The output of this tool is the mls_fluid variable, not the mls one (which can
be overwritten by other tools)

This tool is prepared to work even if it is included more than once. However,
the first time the tool is included, 2 warnings will be reported due to the
impossibility of removing MLS_imove1 and MLS_mls_fluid. Just ignore them.
