<!-- outlet.xml
Outlet (i.e. outflow) boundary condition. An infinite outlet plane can be
defined using this preset.

This preset depends on the computational domain preset domain.xml. Therefore, to
create such outlet boundary condition you must include domain.xml preset and
this file, and after that the following variables should be set:
outlet_r = Infinite plane position.
outlet_n = Outward normal of the infinite plane.

The main defference between the computational domain and the outlet boundary
condition is that the latter is not removing the particles right after they are
tresspasing the boundary, but they are preserved while they are close enough to
affect the fluid particles, such that the domain is not truncated. During this
period drhodt will be enforced to be 0.
