<!-- GPFreeSlip.xml
Ghost Particles are considering no slip boundary conditions by default, but free
slip can be activated with this preset.

You just need to include it, and define which particles set will be affected
setting the variable freeslip_iset (0 by default).

If several boundaries, belonging to different particles sets, should be free
slip enforced, then include this preset several times, and reevaluate the
affected freeslip_iset variable each time, for instance:

<Include file="GPFreeSlip.xml" prefix="iset0_"/>
<Include file="GPFreeSlip.xml" prefix="iset2_"/>
<Tools>
    <Tool action="insert" before="iset0_GP FreeSlip" type="set_scalar" name="freeslip_iset0" in="freeslip_iset" value="0"/>
    <Tool action="insert" before="iset2_GP FreeSlip" type="set_scalar" name="freeslip_iset2" in="freeslip_iset" value="2"/>
</Tools>

    <Include file="../cfd/GPFreeSlip.xml" />
