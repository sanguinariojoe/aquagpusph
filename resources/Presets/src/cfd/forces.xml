<!-- forces.xml
Forces and moments runtime processor.
This preset is designed to be loaded after cfd.xml.

To use it, just include this file, and later set the initial values for the
variables:
forces_r = Position of the center of rotation

This preset is generating the following variables which are the global forces
and moments with respect to forces_r:
forces_F = Fluid forces
forces_M = Fluid moments

With this method the forces are computed by the summation of the fluid particles
acceleration, in order to integrate the forces around an object use
pressureForces.xml and viscousForces.xml.
