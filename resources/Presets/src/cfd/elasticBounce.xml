<!-- ElasticBounce.xml
Set and unpenetrability condition based on an elastic bounce with the wall. It
can be used when a serious risk of particles trespassing solid walls is
considered, but reducing the time step is unacceptable.

The elements considered as elastic bounce ones should be marked with the flag
imove=-2 or imove=-3.

To use this preset just include it. Optionally you can tune the effect of the
elastic bounce using the following definitions:

- __DR_FACTOR__: The factor of the "radius" of the boundary element (1.5f by
default)
- __MIN_BOUND_DIST__: The minimum distance from the boundary, as a factor of dr,
such that the particles are not affected by the elastic bounce (0.3f by default)
- __ELASTIC_FACTOR__: Ammount of energy exchanged in the process. 1.f for a
conservative interaction, 0.f for a total dissipation of the particle kinetic
energy (0.f by default)
